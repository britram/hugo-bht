abstract: > 
  This document specifies the TinyIPFIX protocol that is used for
   transmitting smart-metering data in constrained networks such as IPv6
   over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN, RFC 4944).
   TinyIPFIX is derived from IP Flow Information Export (RFC 7011) and
   adopted to the needs of constrained networks.  This document
   specifies how the TinyIPFIX Data and Template Records are transmitted
   in constrained networks such as 6LoWPAN and how TinyIPFIX data can be
   converted into data that is not TinyIPFIX in a proxy device.
