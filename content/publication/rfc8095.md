    A survey of protocol mechanisms provided by transport protocols standardized
    by the IETF, as the basis for the decomposition of transports into transport
    services; also suitable as an introduction to the diversity of transport
    protocols deployed in the Internet. Covers TCP, MP-TCP, SCTP, UDP, UDP-Lite,
    DCCP, ICMP, RTP, FLUTE?ALC, NORM, as well as TLS, DTLS, and HTTP when used
    as pseudotransports.

abstract: > 
   This document describes, surveys, and classifies the protocol
   mechanisms provided by existing IETF protocols, as background for
   determining a common set of transport services.  It examines the
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Multipath TCP, the Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), the User Datagram Protocol
   (UDP), UDP-Lite, the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), the
   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), the Real-Time Transport
   Protocol (RTP), File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport /
   Asynchronous Layered Coding (FLUTE/ALC) for Reliable Multicast, NACK-
   Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM), Transport Layer Security (TLS),
   Datagram TLS (DTLS), and the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP),
   when HTTP is used as a pseudotransport.  This survey provides
   background for the definition of transport services within the TAPS
   working group.
