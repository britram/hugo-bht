Shamelessly inspired by [Alexander Calder][2], who I followed from [Atlanta][3] to [Pittsburgh][4] to [ZÃ¼rich][5], and inexpertly crafted from stuff I found at Migros, I present my first attempt at a mobile.

(And for those of you who have not yet heard, yes, this commission has a customer: we&#8217;re expecting a daughter in a few weeks. We won&#8217;t be boring the Internet at large with piles of baby pictures, though.)
