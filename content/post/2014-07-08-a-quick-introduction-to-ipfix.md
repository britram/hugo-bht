I recently gave a full-day course on flow measurement at the University of Zürich&#8217;s IfI summer school. The course itself was more or less a stack of my current research interests stapled together; one product was a nice summary version of a tutorial on the IPFIX protocol (on which I&#8217;ve worked on and off for the past nine years), together with an iPython notebook on the subject.

Slides are [here][1], and the notebook is [here][2]. The live version is available from GitHub in the [britram/ipfix_tutorial][3] repository.

And as a bonus on the subject, [here&#8217;s][4] a video of me giving an interview about all this last year in Berlin on _way_ too little sleep.
