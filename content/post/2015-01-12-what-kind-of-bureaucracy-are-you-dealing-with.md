In German, there&#8217;s a word for an organization which takes its mission very seriously but is adorably incompetent at it: &#8220;Kaninchenzüchterverein&#8221; (lit. &#8220;rabbit-breeding club&#8221;). There&#8217;s another word for an organization which is bad at what it does because nobody cares: &#8220;Saftladen&#8221; (lit. &#8220;juice shop&#8221;).

If you can&#8217;t decide what kind of amateur hour you&#8217;re dealing with, though, and suspect an undercurrent of moral reprehensibility to boot, may I suggest just crossing the two, arriving at &#8220;Kaninchenentsaftungsanlage&#8221; (lit. &#8220;bunny-juicing facility&#8221;).
