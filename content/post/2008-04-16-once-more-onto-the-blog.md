<span>All right. Let&#8217;s try this a fourth time then, shall we?</span>

<div>
  <span><br /></span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>I&#8217;ve had a long and incredibly sparse career as a blogger. I was a bit late to the game, starting my first one, <span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Elmer+and+Bellefonte+Streets,+Pittsburgh,+Pennsylvania,+15232&#038;jsv=107&#038;sll=40.45242,-79.9346&#038;sspn=0.006548,0.008529&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=17&#038;iwloc=addr">Elmer and Bellefonte</a></span>, on the twenty-third of August, two thousand one, largely for the purpose of hearing myself rant about various topics of high geekdom. It&#8217;s no longer online, which is no great loss as the only real post of any note on it was a long one, entitled <span>Ramblings on the American Response</span>, dated the twentieth of September of that year, in which among other things I expressed concern that &#8220;[a]s the shock of seeing New York burn wears off, authoritarian interests within our nation are scrambling to make things safer for us (because, of course, they know better) at the expense of civil liberties,&#8221; and vowing without any real conviction that &#8220;[i]f we [do not resist the temptation to authoritarianism], terror wins, America becomes a third world tinpot totalitarian state, and you can reach me at my new forwarding address somewhere in Western Europe.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span><br /></span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Well. A little under seven years later, through a much more, well, ridiculously circuitous course of events in which angst about eroding civil liberties does, I must admit, play a minor supporting role, I&#8217;ll have a new forwarding address somewhere in Western Europe soon enough. In forty six days, five hours, my one-way flight to Zurich lands.</span>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <span>(As an aside for the record, there was a second blog, completely lost to the sands of time; and a third, <span>Tales from the Centerline</span>, which was largely concerned with the summer-long renovation of my Depression-era house atop Pittsburgh&#8217;s Squirrel Hill in 2005. You&#8217;re not missing anything by my never mentioning either of these again.)</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span><br /></span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>So, welcome to my fourth blog. I&#8217;m starting this one to keep in touch with the people I&#8217;m leaving behind here, and to have a public record of what it was like to pick up at thirty and start over (not quite from scratch, mind you) an ocean and a few mountains away. I promise I&#8217;ll try to keep it from going all &#8220;an American in Switzerland&#8221; on you.</span>
