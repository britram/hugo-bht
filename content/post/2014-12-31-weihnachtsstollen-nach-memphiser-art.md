In the back of the pantry at the house I grew up in in Memphis, there was always a stack of little plastic tubs of dried candied &#8220;fruits&#8221; of various colors (I say &#8220;colors&#8221; because the flavor was invariably &#8220;sugar&#8221;). My mother was never much of a baker, except at Christmas, when the baking would take two forms: fruitcake and stollen, both of which were filled with candied fruit. I&#8217;d try Mom&#8217;s fruitcake, the main ingredient of which seemed to be brandy, about once every five years to see if I was finally old enough to enjoy it. I never quite made it.

Stollen, on the other hand, was the main course of most breakfasts around Christmas. This was a bit odd in Memphis, doubly so because we didn&#8217;t have any particularly German ancestors; Mom just saw the recipe in a magazine sometime in the late 70s or early 80s and decided to make a tradition out of it. So I was thrilled when I moved to Switzerland and found out you could buy stollen in the grocery store at Christmastime. Almost as thrilled as I was disappointed when I found out that &#8220;real&#8221; Stollen is basically a marzipan delivery system.

So this year I decided to try my hand at tweaking the basic recipe for stollen to see if I could come up with something that tasted like Christmas back home. Starting from a [BBC recipe][1] and editing mainly by omission, this is what I came up with:

### Ingredients

#### Dough:

  * 500g finely ground white flour (in Switzerland: &#8220;Zopfmehl&#8221;)
  * 100g caster sugar (&#8220;Feinster Zucker&#8221;)
  * 10g salt
  * 14g dry yeast
  * 150g butter
  * 250mL milk

#### Filling:

  * ground cloves (&#8220;a pinch&#8221;)
  * nutmeg (offically &#8220;a pinch&#8221;, but as Mom generally used as much nutmeg as she could get away with before people started [hallucinating][2], &#8220;more than a pinch&#8221;. I used a 3:1 ratio to the cloves.)
  * seeds from 1/2 pod vanilla
  * 50g thinly sliced almonds
  * 100g candied lemon peel
  * 100g candied fruit
  * 150g raisins (of which 75g dark and 75g light)

#### Glaze:

  * Powdered sugar
  * Thinly sliced almonds

### Preparation

Mix all filling ingredients together in a bowl, let stand.

Mix 1tsp sugar, 50mL warm milk, and yeast, let rest a few minutes. Combine flour and sugar in bowl. Add salt to one side of bowl and yeast to other side. Add softened butter and milk, stir together. Knead dough ca. 7 min. on a floured surface.

Fold mixed filling into dough and knead to thoroughly mix filling into dough. Form two balls, let stand ca. 1 hour until risen to double size. Form each ball into a long loaf, bake in non-preheated oven 190°C ca. 1 hour.

Mix powered sugar with a few drops of water at a time to make a thick glaze. Brush this glaze over each loaf before it cools, and press sliced almonds into the glaze. Let dry and cool.

### Serving

Slice ca. 1cm thick, butter, and broil slices until light brown.
