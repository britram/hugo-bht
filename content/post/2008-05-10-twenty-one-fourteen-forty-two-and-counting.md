<span>Time, it feels, is running out.</span>

<div>
  <span>My standard policy with respect to moving is basically not to move, which given that I&#8217;ve moved once every two years or so pretty reliably since 1995, is probably not a good standard policy. What this means is that I generally leave the actual mechanics of moving off to the last minute, madly throwing things into boxes when the truck pulls up downstairs, and utterly failing to sort out the mess after the fact. <span><span>(This should perhaps be an indication that I have no real use for most of my stuff, but that&#8217;s another issue entirely.)</span></span></span>

  <span>So it is this time. Twenty-one days is not at all last-minute given my history, but given the somewhat different logistics of crossing the ocean, feels it. I&#8217;ve tried tricking myself into moving by pulling the art off the walls (always the last to go in the past) and I think it seems to be working. Indeed, I probably would have gotten some packing done last night had it not been for Game 1 of the Yuengling Conference Finals, absolutely worth it in every way, especially considering the result.</span>

  <span>(Speaking of, Malkin&#8217;s shortie last night, I must say, was not only poetic payback for the mugging he took on his short-handed attempt of a few seconds before, but also made up nicely for his penalty &#8220;shot&#8221; against the Rangers last series, and beyond that, was one of the prettiest goals I&#8217;ve seen this year in its simplicity. But reviewing individual goals in pretentious art-critic style isn&#8217;t getting any furniture down my stairs, so I digress&#8230;)</span>
