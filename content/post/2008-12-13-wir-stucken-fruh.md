So, I apparently now how to speak German now, at least a bit. Finished the first course this week, passed the final, did quite well aside from the fact I thought that &#8220;frühstücken&#8221; (to breakfast) was separable (&#8220;Ich stücke heute nicht früh.&#8221;) which it isn&#8217;t (&#8220;Ich frühstücke heute nicht.&#8221;) This means &#8220;I don&#8217;t eat breakfast today,&#8221; which, depending on your definition of &#8220;breakfast&#8221; and what time of day it is right now, may or may not actually be true.

  I wasn&#8217;t the only person to make this mistake, as the general rule is verb prefixes are separable if they are themselves German words, which &#8220;früh&#8221; (&#8220;early&#8221;) clearly is. After some discussion we&#8217;ve decided either 1. that we&#8217;re going to avoid &#8220;frühstücken&#8221; as a verb entirely (&#8220;Heute habe ich das Frühstück nicht gegessen&#8221;) or 2. be cocky beginning-German students and take back &#8220;wir stücken früh&#8221;. Languages, after all, are changed only by single coinages by single innovators, and if the English loanverb &#8220;downloaden&#8221; (&#8220;ich loade etwas down&#8221;) is separable, then dammit, so is frühstücken.
