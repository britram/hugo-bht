Too much going on here to write about any of it. I&#8217;m still collecting my notes for The Post On The Apartment Search, which if it goes on much longer might make a reasonably good Russian novella.

  It&#8217;s overcast, again, today, and threatening to rain, as it has been every day I have been here in Zürich except yesterday. My original plan if it was raining today was to take advantage of the insanely great train system here to go to Ticino, across the Alps, where the weather is usually better. But it turns out that not only is it raining in Ticino, it&#8217;s raining in Switzerland in general; Zürich, at least, seems to be the least rainy place in the whole country. So. Think I&#8217;ll wander about for a while and try not imagine not being able to afford living in each building I pass by.

  But I did want to share this one little story in the meantime.

  Now, I&#8217;ve been continually amazed at fairly regular appearance of Confederate battle flags on pickup trucks bearing West Virginia plates. Okay, maybe I&#8217;m not amazed, but I do wryly appreciate the irony. However, wandering around in Unterstrass (or was it Fluntern? it&#8217;s all starting to run together) the other day looking at apartments (what else, really?), I happened to see a little battle flag sticker right above the Kanton Zürich plates on an otherwise unadorned black Toyota Corolla. Er, what? <span>Apologies to all for not having a camera on me.</span>
