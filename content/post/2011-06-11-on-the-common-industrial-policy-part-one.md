When I first moved to Switzerland, I had an office just off Stockerstrasse in Zürich, on a street lined with older houses filled with smallish offices of firms that do various essential but boring things for banks and insurance companies. I hardly ever saw it, given my schedule. Once every couple of weeks or so, I&#8217;d stop in to check the post, maybe have a coffee with colleagues whose names I can now hardly remember. Almost everything about the office, actually, was unmemorable, and I suppose now that this was intentional.<!--more-->

I&#8217;d had something of a dead-end job back in the States. What I did was not important — suffice it to say it was one of those sitting in a reasonably comfortable chair, staring at a glowing rectangle sort of situations — but the main problem wasn&#8217;t the sameness, it was the sense that there was nowhere to _go_. My next move was to wait for my boss to get promoted and take his job, which I in no way wanted, because while he had a more comfortable chair to sit in and a bigger glowing rectangle to sit in front of, most of his time seemed to be taken up with the unpleasantries of office politics. If I wanted to be on a permanent campaign, I&#8217;d have run for _actual_ office.

A conversation to this point with a friend on my front porch over a scotch or three led in a roundabout way to my answering an ad in the Economist — no, not the section up front with the placements for the new Chief Economist of the World Organization for Important Stuff or tenders for auditors for the Islamic Democratic People&#8217;s Revolutionary Republic of Nowhere. I mean the other section in the back with the ads for dodgy tax avoidance schemes and opportunities to buy unlisted shares in mining operations in the Islamic Democratic People&#8217;s Revolutionary Republic of Nowhere. &#8220;Live and Work in Europe&#8221; it said, &#8220;placements for qualified English-speaking individuals, any field&#8221; and a telephone number with too many digits in it, which a quick Google search told me was clearly not in Nigeria. It seemed legit, as a long-shot escape route, anyway. Six months later, I had a B permit and a desk with three less-luxurious glowing rectangles, old-school CRTs, a much-more-comfortable Herman Miller chair, and an excellent view of an alley with recycling bins in it.

My new job, as near as I could figure, was what I would call business consulting. I would fly in, take the train or cab or whatever out to some company in a business park somewhere, have a few hours of generic conversation in front of a projected image of warmed-over Powerpoint slide deck nobody had ever actually read, least of all the presenter. Then they&#8217;d sit me down in front of a giant pile of documentation, and I&#8217;d read it and find at least one thing wrong with it — this generally consisted merely of pointing out internal inconsistencies within the documentation itself. I&#8217;d type up a quick memo to tell them what I&#8217;d found, collect my check, and fly off to the next job. After a while I couldn&#8217;t even tell you the names of my clients. They all run one into another, now, in my memory, one giant, multiheaded, indivisible, dysfunctional beast of a pharmaceutical insurance retailing banking recycling logistics bakery.

The first few months were great; I got to see Europe, or at least a hotels-and-business-parks version of it, for free. I got status on Swiss (which I must say I recommend, if only for the lounge at the airport in Zürich). In the stolen moments between the job and the flight I could often even pop into the old city and make a couple of interesting photographs: single-serving tourism.

On the odd days off I&#8217;d head down to one of the several expat bars in town — usually &#8220;English&#8221; pubs but there was this one random Korean place not too far from the Schanzengraben, too, that I was especially fond of — and eventually fell in with an irregular group of people from everywhere and nowhere for weekly drinks: an Austrian painter, a couple of tri-lingual rock-climbers of complicated nationality, a hairdresser from the suburbs of Stuttgart who was the most dedicated Minnesota Vikings fan I&#8217;ve ever met, a Frenchwoman who maintained apartments here and in Paris and switched back and forth every couple of months because the grass was always greener on the other side of the border, and so on. Aside from Andreas, the hairdresser, we all had either somewhat cryptic or terribly boring day jobs, and none of us talked much about work.

It was at one of weekly gabfests, where we were all complaining half-heartedly about first-world problems (climbing injuries, the crap season the Vikings were having, the costs of trans-border commuting) that the pointlessness of what I was doing started to creep into my consciousness. I mean, I&#8217;d presumed to that point that someone, somewhere was getting some actual _value_ from me pointing out that they didn&#8217;t really need a distribution center in a country in which they had neither factories nor clients. But as soon as I&#8217;d said that, new job, new pile of paper, and I&#8217;d never hear from them again. Okay, fine. Most people never understand the real impact of what they do, anyway.

&#8220;Do you ever get the sense that what you do doesn&#8217;t, you know, matter?&#8221; I said, maybe a bit too plaintively, over the fourth beer, to nobody in particular.

Andreas shook his head. &#8220;Nope. People come in, messy hair. They leave, neat hair. Simple. But then I don&#8217;t really get what you, you know, do.&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t actually, either,&#8221; I said as if some great truth were dawning on me.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it&#8221; — this was Olivie, the part-time Parisian — &#8220;Most things are bullshit. Get paid for it. Go home. Then go snowboarding.&#8221;

I wasn&#8217;t listening. &#8220;Um, I perform on-site reviews of the strategy of a large variety of medium to large international businesses, and consult with them on inefficiencies, inconsistencies, or other issues in those strategies, in order to help them make their businesses run more effectively?&#8221; I still wasn&#8217;t sure on this point, though, so I threw in: &#8220;I guess?&#8221;

Everyone stared at me. Andreas slowly took another sip of his beer.

&#8220;I convert surplus cash from a variety of industries into airline tickets?&#8221;

&#8220;That,&#8221; said Olivie, &#8220;sounds more like it. Get you something from the bar?&#8221;

It wasn&#8217;t &#8217;til the next day at the office that I started looking into exactly how right I was.
