I didn't post a single thing to my rebooted-five-years-ago blog last year. I'd like to think this is because I've been doing better things with my time. I've rebooted the site to give a better picture of what I've been up to. Most of this has been professional, or at least [amateurish-but-paid](/#projects), but the [beer's](https://smoothvalley.trammell.ch) coming along nicely, too.
