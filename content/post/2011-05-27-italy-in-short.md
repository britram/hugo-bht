I&#8217;ve got a lot of random things I&#8217;d like to put up here (yet another essay on how politics-as-football-hooliganism sucks, a short story about alternate-universe American apartheid, reflections on flight) but the weather sucks (can&#8217;t see the Uetliberg from the office) and I&#8217;m being rather productive, so in lieu thereof, please accept this picture of a cute little red car.<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
