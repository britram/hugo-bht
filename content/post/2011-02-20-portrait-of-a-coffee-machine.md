[<img class="alignleft" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5461189241_a38178de06.jpg" alt="Portrait of a Coffee Machine" width="254" height="500" />][1]Stuck at home this weekend: doctor said stay off a rather badly twisted ankle, not from snowboarding in Arosa, but from falling down the damn stairs in Bahnhof Chur _after_ snowboarding. The upside is I&#8217;ve got a nice new [lens][2] to play with, so I&#8217;ve been shuffling and lurching around the flat taking photos of anything that doesn&#8217;t move.

Have also finally made some progress on re-sorting my backlog of photos that goes back to Pittsburgh, so look for new stuff to show up on [Flickr][3] over the next weeks.
