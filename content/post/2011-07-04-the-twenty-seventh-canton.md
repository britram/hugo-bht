[<img class="alignleft" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5898150637_344ddeea1f.jpg" alt="Tower, Valüna" width="333" height="500" />][1] Went to Liechtenstein yesterday, to walk around in the mountains a bit and build stone towers in the Valünabach. What&#8217;s odd is how little it feels like anything other than a bit of Switzerland that found itself stuck on the wrong side of the Rhine, like the Rafzerfeld, or Schaffhausen.

Sure, the hikers you pass say &#8220;Höi!&#8221; instead of &#8220;Grüezi!&#8221;, the signs are different enough that most hardened roadgeeks could tell _something_ was off, and the density of [black license plates][2] measurably higher than in Zürich. But otherwise, it&#8217;s hard to tell it&#8217;s (technically) another country.
