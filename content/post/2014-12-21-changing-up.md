Another December, another month inside hiding from the fog,Â and it&#8217;s time for another blog facelift. I&#8217;m intending to post a bit more frequently on more technical topics, from the mundane (the standard vi v. emacs fare of many a coder&#8217;s blog) to the philosophical (what is the Internet, _really_?) to the unrelated (as I still at least have a series on kayaking in Switzerland I&#8217;d like to see finished someday).

Stay tuned for something (in)completely different.
