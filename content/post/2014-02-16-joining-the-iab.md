Well, it&#8217;s [official][1]. I&#8217;ll be joining the [Internet Architecture BoardÂ ][2]for a two-year term starting at IETF 89 in March. Among other things, the IAB provides architectural oversight of IETF protocols, which are surprisingly coherent given the nearly perfectly bottom-up nature of the process that produces them. I look forward to the challenge in meta-[cat-herding][3].
