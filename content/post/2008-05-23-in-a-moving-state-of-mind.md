I think it&#8217;s safe to say it&#8217;s crunch time now. I&#8217;ve got a little more than a hundred hours left here in Pittsburgh, the final details of my arrival in Zürich are very nearly sorted out, and now it&#8217;s down to the disposition of individual boxes and the things in them.

  Things. It strikes me that if I only owned the things I <span>actually used</span>, the whole act of moving across the ocean would be, aside from the unavoidable bureaucracy, not all that difficult. There&#8217;s the cliché, of course, that you don&#8217;t own your things, your things own you, but I&#8217;d always sort of taken that as a warning about your more advanced stages of materialism, that if you find yourself rubbing down your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Murci%C3%A9lago">Murciélago</a> with a diaper each Sunday morning, you&#8217;ve taken things too far. One of the many things the move to Zürich has taught me so far <span>before it&#8217;s even happened</span> is that this is not the case. Indeed, your things begin to own you as soon as you assign value to them, regardless of the value they actually hold.

  I shall pledge now (and hope not to break said pledge immediately) that I&#8217;ll remember this feeling every time I&#8217;m about to acquire yet more stuff.

  And yet&#8230; there&#8217;s still the little whining voice in the back of my head pointing out all the additional photographs I could take more easily by shifting a few hundred dollars of the money I&#8217;ve made selling all my stuff into bringing yet a third <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canonG9/">camera</a> with me.
