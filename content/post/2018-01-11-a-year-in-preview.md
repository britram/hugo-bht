A blog you post to once or twice a year lends itself to year-end wrap-ups, but I wanted to do something a little different this time around. So briefly: In 2017 I did some work, took some photos, kayaked a bit, tried to like Linux on the desktop and failed, taught my daughter to count to fifteen in English, and became a Swiss citizen.

Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about 2018.

## Art

*Resolution number 1*: I'm going to write more this year, and put more effort into my photography. 

Writing: hopefully there will be more stuff here by January 2019.

Photography: I'm not terribly happy with any of the available cloudish ways to
publish photos, and development on Web photo galleries seems to be stuck in
the middle of last decade, so I suspect this means I'm also going to be
learning some JavaScript.

## Politics

*Resolution number 2*: I'm going to work to become less politically ineffective.

Like, I suspect, most Americans who have a smartphone, I spent way more time
in 2017 rage-refreshing Twitter to catch up on the ongoing collapse of the
institution of the Presidency of the United States than is probably healthy.
I'm going to do less of that sort of thing this year: no amount of my
attention from here in Wallisellen will change the fact that American
democracy, in its present form, is a complete write-off, and will need to be
rebuilt from the grassroots up with a revised political culture. A drastic
simplification of the problem here is that the work of the Union in the Civil
War and Reconstruction era remains incomplete. I hope very much there's a way
to finish it that doesn't involve another war, though I'm not optimistic that
significant progress will be made here during my lifetime.

That political culture itself, though, is exportable, and remains a danger for
any nation with politicians who seek power and can comprehend enough English
to read and understand its propaganda. Along with the red book, I've acquired
the responsibility to do what I can to quarantine Switzerland from American
politics; on which watch this space, and read

Politics is also local.
