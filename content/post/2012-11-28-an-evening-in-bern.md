The [Internet Society Switzerland Chapter&#8217;s][1] inaugural national event was last night at the [Käfigturm][2] in Bern; in my talk, [&#8220;The Open Internet under Threat&#8221;][3] (which, as it turns out, was unwittingly inspired in part by a [much earlier post][4] on this blog; slides are [here][5]), I accomplished what I set out to do, I think — start a conversation about the present state of the Internet, and threats to its openness, to figure out where we ISOC people as politically-interested network geeks can make a difference. Balthasar Glättli&#8217;s talk on Internet politics in Switzerland, and the conversations that followed both talks, were eye-opening, ranging from the education of politicians on even the most basic technical realities of the Internet through framing Internet freedom issues for random people off the street to exactly how much regulation is necessary or desirable to guarantee the fundamental rights behind network neutrality. Thanks to ISOC, the sponsors, the organizers, and all who attended, for an interesting evening in Bern!
