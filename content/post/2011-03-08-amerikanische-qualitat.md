Got yet another SVP (Swiss People&#8217;s Party) flyer stuffed in the mailbox yesterday, outlining what passes for their platform for the April cantonal elections, which is a straight cognitively-dissonant mix between xenophobic nationalism and classical liberalism. _Schweizer wählen SVP_, it says: Swiss people vote SVP, the implication being that all the other parties are for people who are somehow _less than Swiss_. The party somewhat disappointingly leaves the question of the impact of the rather stark protectionism implied by disengagement from Europe on the freedom of markets and Switzerland&#8217;s competitiveness unanswered. I get the impression this is because actually attempting to answer such a question would require nuance, which doesn&#8217;t fit onto a triple-folded A4 flyer in 36-point type underneath the picture of the scary foreigner. (You&#8217;d hope they&#8217;d be smart enough to realize, at least from the mailboxes, that they were advertising to a building full of binational couples. But alas.)

I&#8217;ve been grappling with my concept of the SVP for a while. I would associate the level of rhetoric (which, as I&#8217;ve noted before, leads me to sympathy with gangsters, which I&#8217;m guessing is not the intent) with nascent political violence by paranoid schizophrenics (cf. Jared Loughner and the Tucson shooting). I bring this up with Swiss people and they look at me like I&#8217;m mad. The problem is I assume that all right-wing loons are Americans — slightly unhinged, heavily armed — while they&#8217;re assuming the SVP right-wing loons are Swiss — basically reasonable, still armed, but with cause: they&#8217;re in the army reserve (just like everyone else), they&#8217;ve got better firearms training, and they&#8217;re not following a dogmatic independent-clause interpretation of the Second Amendment, which, of course, isn&#8217;t in effect here anyway.

Assuming they&#8217;re reasonable makes them a lot less scary. Let&#8217;s face it, the one thing they&#8217;ve managed to actually _change_ of late is banning minarets a year and a half ago, a meaningless little piece of symbolic islamophobia that&#8217;s been largely forgotten. I wasn&#8217;t planning on building one anyway. Yeah, their _Ausschafungsinitiative_ makes it indeterminably easier to deport &#8220;criminal foreigners&#8221;, which in SVPlerisch means &#8220;all foreigners&#8221;, but you still have to actually _do something_ to get thrown out, and the initiative itself was so poorly written that it&#8217;ll take five years to figure out how to implement the damn thing. Okay, it might get me deported if I decide to drive 210 km/h, drunk, down the A1, but this is also not putting a huge crimp in my plans for the weekend. The Smart&#8217;s rev-limited to 135 in any case.

No, the problem isn&#8217;t that the SVP is preaching xenophobia to the Swiss. Switzerland was basically founded (in [legend][1] anyway) on a 13th-century pact to keep the outsiders from overrunning them, and is one of the few places in Europe which still uses dialect in the open as a way of separating Swiss from non-Swiss (and indeed, Bündner from Berner from Zürcher from Walliser). An inward-facing viewpoint is built into the culture.

The problem, ironically, is that the SVP is _importing_ the worst features of American politics into Switzerland: twenty-second soundbites, casting of nuance as weakness, nationalist exceptionalism, and above all a culture of reaction to fear. Christoph Blocher, the [man][2] behind the [haircut][3], who sets the party&#8217;s agenda, has been called [Switzerland&#8217;s Karl Rove][4], and reported to be a great admirer of the Turd Blossom&#8217;s work. Which is sad. One of the things I was happy to be leaving behind was the screaming dysfunction that passes for political engagement in America, and I hope it doesn&#8217;t rot Switzerland&#8217;s uniquely participative democracy, especially before I get a chance to take part.
