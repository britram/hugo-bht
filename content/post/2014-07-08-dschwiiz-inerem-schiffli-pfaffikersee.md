So it hasn&#8217;t been all work: the weather (though it&#8217;s tragic today) has cooperated with my calendar on occasion, and I&#8217;ve had a few chances to throw the boat on the water. So this begins what I home will become an occasional series on paddling around Switzerland with a sea kayak.

The weekend before last, I decided to try out the Pfäffikersee (&#8220;Lake Pfäffikon&#8221;, though the lake isn&#8217;t really big enough to warrant a translation). At 2500m x 1200m, it&#8217;s possible to do a full roundtrip around the lake in about an hour without pushing too hard.

<!--more-->Access is something of an issue. First, the Pfäffikersee is a nature reserve, unlike many lakes in the Mittelland surrounded by a sizable wetland. The lake is open April through October, though much of the shoreline is closed throughout the year, so it&#8217;s important to stay on the middle-of-the-lake side of the orange buoys (see the 

[flyer][1] on the nature reserve, in German). This means the possibilities for throwing a kayak on the water are also limited.

There&#8217;s a low quay on the promenade in Pfäffikon, which is a reasonably short walk to the train station, and would be an option for bringing a smallish folding boat via S-Bahn. Parking is severely limited in Pfäffikon itself, though, and there does not appear to be any access for boats near Pfäffikon&#8217;s Seebadi. There also appears to be kayak-friendly access at Seegräben, but parking is also generally limited by the proximity to Jucker Farmart and there&#8217;s a 10% grade down to the lake over about 220m.

So I put in at the Seebad on the southern shore of the lake in Robenhausen (Wetzikon), with ample free parking and a small boat launch maintained by the sailing club. There&#8217;s even a small patch of grass well-sized to assemble the Feathercraft.

There was light sailboat and rowboat traffic on the lake, with rowboat rental from Pfäffikon&#8217;s promenade, and even another canoe and another seekayak (a fiberglass Prijon) out on the water. The lake is far enough up in the Zürcher Oberland that there&#8217;s a decent view of the mountains, though that was a bit limited by the weather last weekend.

Verdict: definitely a nice afternoon paddle if you&#8217;re already in Wetzikon.
