Nope, this isn&#8217;t about web privacy.

My old blog had a tag called &#8220;Royale mit Käse&#8221;, on the little differences between Switzerland and America. One of the bigger little differences is the sweetness of dessert.

My mom once sent me a care package full of Mrs. Fields cookies (&#8220;trans-fats are proof that there is a God, he loves us, and he wants us to be insanely fat&#8221;) with the approximate energy density of a neutron star; these would induce a temporary diabetic coma in the average Swiss person.

On the other hand, for dessert one night this weekend, we had something more traditional, which as near as I can tell was basically grits with extra gluten and a pinch of sugar. Two scoops of ice cream on top of that and I could barely taste it, which made it just about tolerable.

After a couple of years here, my palate&#8217;s definitely leaning somewhere in the middle of these two extremes. Start-with-a-quarter-pound-of-butter recipes just don&#8217;t work any more. So without further ado I present my adjusted-for-Switzerland portable cookie recipe. This basically started as the average of a few American sugar-cookies-from-scratch recipes I found on the web, with the sugar and butter scaled way back.

<!--more-->First, cream together:

  * 70g butter
  * 140g sugar
  * 15g vanilla sugar
  * 1 egg
  * pinch salt

<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">At this point, you can layer a flavor on top of the sugar base. If you want chocolate chunk cookies, smash a bar of Cailler Dark with a hammer after eating a couple of squares for yourself, and cream the powder and chunks in. For lime cookies, grate the peel of one lime, then squeeze in the juice for good measure. I&#8217;ve made cinnamon sugar cookies with this base once, but they weren&#8217;t very good so I&#8217;ll leave the proportions as an exercise for the reader.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">Now mix the following together:</span></span>

  * <span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">250g flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">8g baking powder</span>

and add that to the sugar-butter-egg-hammered-chocolate a little bit at a time. You probably won&#8217;t use all of it. But you might need a little more flour. You know you&#8217;re done when you can form the dough into a ball without too much sticking to your hands. Stick this ball in a bowl into the fridge for a while. Might want to cover it unless you want cookies that taste like your fridge.

Preheat the oven to 200°C, place ~2 cm diameter balls of dough on a piece of baking paper on a baking sheet. Bake ~8-10 min, until they&#8217;re done enough for you. This makes more than a dozen, less than two. Just multiply or divide the numbers as appropriate for more, or fewer, though keep in mind non-integer numbers of eggs can be tricky. Hm, I suppose this makes these _scalable_ portable cookies, as well, doesn&#8217;t it?
