I&#8217;m back, and winter is gone.

Allergies notwithstanding, it&#8217;s a great week to camp out on the balcony. Not so much to be sitting in front of a glowing rectangle, which is what they pay me for. So recreational glowing-rectangle-sitting is right out. The 870 frames I shot in Atlanta, Memphis, and Prague will just have to wait.

For now, here&#8217;s a picture of some bugs found on Central Avenue.<figure style="width: 380px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
