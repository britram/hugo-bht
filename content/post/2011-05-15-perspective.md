To put the Mississippi River flooding in perspective for a Swiss audience:

The flow rate of the Mississippi River at the Old River Control Structure is 2.153 million cubic feet per second, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers. There are 3.3 cubic kilometers of water in Lake Zürich, according to Wolfram Alpha (!)

Which means one Lake Zürich is going past the ORCS _every fifteen hours_. The same amount of water goes down the Limmat every 440 days.
