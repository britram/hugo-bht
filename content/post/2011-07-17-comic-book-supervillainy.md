I opened the NZZ am Sonntag (the Sunday edition of the [Neue Zürcher Zeitung][1], the paper of record for German-speaking Switzerland) today to read of yet another threat from Switzerland&#8217;s current favorite comic-book supervillain: Starker Franken.<!--more-->

This week, its was &#8220;Starker Franken gefährdet eintausend Hotels&#8221; (&#8220;&#8230;endangers a thousand hotels&#8221;). Last week, &#8220;Starker Franken droht die Löhne&#8221; (&#8220;&#8230;threatens wages&#8221;). I&#8217;m half expecting next week to read &#8220;Starker Franken ermordet zwei Landsmänner in einer Messerstecherei in Langstrasse&#8221; (&#8220;&#8230;kills two compatriots in a knife fight in Langstrasse [Zürich&#8217;s red light district]&#8221;) or, even worse, &#8220;Starker Franken ist mit 225 km/h auf der A1 bei Kölliken von der aargauischen Kantonspolizei kontrolliert geworden&#8221; (&#8220;&#8230;got caught speeding.&#8221;)

Starker Franken means, of course, &#8220;strong Franc (currency)&#8221;, and I&#8217;m not making light of the difficulty. On the one hand, I&#8217;ve gotten a 30% raise in dollar terms over the last three years, just sitting here. On the other, the relative strength of the franc to the euro is crushing export-related sectors of the economy, which in a country roughly the size of Maryland, Delaware, and DC, is &#8220;most of them&#8221;. The Swiss national bank ran out of money a couple of years ago trying to keep the Euro exchange rate manageable, and got stuck with a big fat paper loss denominated in Euros in doing so. Deflation is not inevitable, but it&#8217;s less unthinkable than it should be in an economy that&#8217;s basically stable and not in debt up to its ears. So, yeah, villainy.

But it&#8217;s kind of hard to take the angst seriously when it&#8217;s reported with tabloid breathlessness week after week above the fold on the front page of a supposedly august newspaper.
