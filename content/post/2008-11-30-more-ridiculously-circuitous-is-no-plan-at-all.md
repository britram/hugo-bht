It&#8217;s two on a Sunday morning, and I&#8217;m coming up on the last twenty-four hours of my first six months in Switzerland. I&#8217;ve just rotated the flat (i.e. moved nearly all the furniture a hundred eighty degrees along the outside wall of the living room) on the suggestion of a friend about a month ago and I have to say she was right, it&#8217;s much better this way.

  Half a year ago I stepped off an airplane and looking back I marvel at how clueless I was, which feels good until I realize I&#8217;ll most probably be able to say the same thing about myself now in another half a year. Indeed this is probably a sign I&#8217;m not wasting my time.

  In the world outside, not that much has changed it seems. The global economy collapsed, sure, but the real damage had already been done so I can&#8217;t really count that as a change. And of course, speaking of Change, Barack Obama has become President-Elect of the United States; indeed this would have been the subject of a deeper post on this very blog entitled &#8220;Four Eleven Changed Everything&#8221; had I been able to come up with anything more to say than the title.  </p>

    And in the world inside, I&#8217;ve learned a few important things. First and foremost would have to be that life is in essence unpredictable, or at least it is unpredictable <span>by me</span>. Maybe the rest of you are really good at filling in the blanks ahead of time, but almost every detail of the last half of 2008 has come to me as a complete and total surprise. Trying to fill in a deeper picture than that may be fun and certainly passes the time, but should be labeled for entertainment purposes only.

    Despite the downs of the roller-coaster ride it&#8217;s been, the ups have been immeasurably more than worth it, and I still look out the window occasionally and can&#8217;t quite believe I&#8217;ve made it here. This should finally clear shortly, I hope, as I need to get the dazed look out of my eyes at some point so I can continue on with the business of living here and choosing what, precisely, that means for me.

    There&#8217;s more I&#8217;m sure, but I can&#8217;t express it in any but the most impossibly trite greeting card language at the moment (what do you want, it&#8217;s two in the morning?) and I have a train to catch soon.
