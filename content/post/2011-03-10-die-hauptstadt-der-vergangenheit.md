I&#8217;m packing for a trip to Memphis, for what will probably be the last time in the foreseeable future. I can&#8217;t really say that I&#8217;ll miss it. It&#8217;s a great place to be _from_, I guess, and the instant Elvis-and-Jack-Daniels association it has in the eyes of Europeans has started many an interesting train conversation. But most everyone I know, save a couple of friends and a pile of Facebook acquaintances, has moved on. My mother was a compelling reason to book a flight, but she&#8217;s gone now, too, and my stepfather moved shortly thereafter to San Diego. Even the Last Cat Standing in the ten year battle over the house has found a new home. All that&#8217;s left is the house itself, full of stuff. Most of this stuff is future garbage, if it isn&#8217;t already present garbage, which I&#8217;m off to dig through in order to find the small bits that aren&#8217;t.

This is doubly weird, as Memphis is basically the capital of my past, and it&#8217;s pretty much impossible to travel there without also traveling in time.

<!--more-->I haven&#8217;t lived there for sixteen years, but up until I left the States it was always &#8220;back home&#8221;. It&#8217;s said you can never go back, but this sentiment, I think, might be reserved for people who haven&#8217;t moved across an ocean. Everything here — the sights, the sounds, the smells — is still basically new, so the old senses tie stronger to the old memories. My America clock is stuck in 2008. I can&#8217;t even see Germantown Parkway without being thrown back into a shopping trip for turkey for some Thanksgiving past, and the unremitting ugliness of Germantown Parkway is not one of those things that people get misty about.

On a more practical note, for those of you who are actually reading this, I&#8217;ll be disappearing for a while. No Internet out at the house, bouncing back and forth between Memphis and Atlanta, then going to Prague for a week and a half, where it&#8217;ll be busy. See y&#8217;all in April.
