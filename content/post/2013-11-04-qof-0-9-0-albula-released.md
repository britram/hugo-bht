The QoF TCP-performance-aware IPFIX flow meter I&#8217;ve been working on, on and off, for about a year, now seems to produce halfway plausible results and hardly crashes at all anymore, which means it&#8217;s time to follow the path of real artists immemorial and ship it already: see [here][1], or if you&#8217;re really serious about it, just track master on [github][2].

For now, the best way to get started is to have a look at the [HowTo][3] in the wiki at github.

Special thanks to Chris Inacio and Emily Sarneso at the CERT Network Situational Awareness Group for keeping YAF in such good (and extensible!) shape.
