So winter was fun<sup>1</sup>. We got back on the bikes today to follow up last year&#8217;s [easiest possible crossing of Switzerland][1] with an attempt to cross Switzerland kind of sort of north to south, so we closed a relatively flat gap in our map for a possible southeast crossing via Uster and Rapperswil (21km).<figure id="attachment_1069" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<!--more-->Given that I warmed up the bike tires again with a quick ride out to the Greifensee

<sup>2</sup> (27km) a couple of weeks ago (which I found anyway despite riding through Dübendorf at a 60° angle to the road I thought I was on) and to Buchs ZH (26km) during last Saturday&#8217;s [_Föhnwetter_][3] (which I found anyway despite somehow losing National Route 1), I now declare the season officially open.

[2] I refuse to translate this to Lake Gryphon, because while the lake is nice to kayak on, it is not of a scale that warrants a mythical name.
