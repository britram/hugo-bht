Greetings, all, from the new trammell.ch. I&#8217;m finally onshoring most of my IT to a [hosting provider][1] in Switzerland, about five years late. Things you may notice if you&#8217;re a geek: the website is https-by-default now (with a free, don&#8217;t-give-me-your-credit-card-details certificate) and available via IPv6 (thanks to [Hurricane Electric][2], at least until Nine goes native everywhere in their internal network). Also, the archives contain all the content from the old and busted blog, My Ridiculously Circuitous Plan, so if you want to go read about me moving to Switzerland again, you can [do that][3] without jumping over to Blogspot.
