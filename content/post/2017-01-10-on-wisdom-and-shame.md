I didn't write anything about the election of America's next president, except
for [a tweet](https://twitter.com/britram/status/796261251336773632) the
morning after pointing out that the America that elected Trump
is the America I left in large part because it was obvious that it was broken
enough to do something like elect Trump. In contrast
[to 2012](/2012/10/four-more-years-in-switzerland/),
I did vote, and in the week leading up to the election I went from seeing a
vote for Hillary as a necessary duty to keep the inability of the Republican
party to manage itself from causing a geopolitical disaster to something I
could actually be proud of. Chalk that up to good marketing on her part.

There's not much I can say about post-truth that hasn't already been said.
Watching the transition amble forward toward the inauguration next Friday,
though, and considering the impact Trump's victory -- in the context of
Putin's and Erdogan's victories -- has for the future of the rule of law in
the West, it occurs to me there is something to be said about the future of
wisdom, and of shame.

First, to wisdom.
