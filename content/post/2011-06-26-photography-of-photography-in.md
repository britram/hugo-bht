I&#8217;m on a train to Paris now, my camera in my backpack on the seat in front of me (the 9:00 Zürich to Basel is surprisingly empty). I&#8217;ve got a few hours to walk around and shoot, assuming I don&#8217;t melt in the thirty-degree heat. And I&#8217;m pledging right now that I&#8217;m not going to point my camera within five degrees of the Eiffel Tower.

It&#8217;s not because I already have a good one of the tower (I don&#8217;t, really), or that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m capable of taking a photo of the tower that hasn&#8217;t already been taken (here, I admit, I&#8217;m reasonably certain I&#8217;m not). It&#8217;s not a general avoidance of overexposed subjects, either — I personally think that one of the best photographs I&#8217;ve ever taken was of the Golden Gate, which is one of three or four man-made things in the world as often photographed as the Eiffel.

It&#8217;s a question of opportunity cost. Last week I was in Heidelberg, which to my American eyes still looks like it was built to provide a model of how a southern German city should look: church in the middle, bridge over a river running through a steep canyon, partially ruined castle on a hill. And the only thing I shot that was worth anything was this.

Could be anywhere. But when you&#8217;re working to take a photograph _of_ a place, to somehow capture its essence, or document its eccentricity, a task made all the more difficult by overexposure, you can miss the images that just happen to be _in_ the place. (There&#8217;s probably a Ferris Buelleresque bit of wisdom to be mined from that, but I&#8217;ve not yet had enough coffee to find it&#8230;)
