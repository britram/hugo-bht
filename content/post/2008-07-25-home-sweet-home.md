I moved into the flat yesterday. By &#8220;moved in&#8221;, I mean most of my stuff is there, I have a motley and assorted collection of furniture, much of which is still boxed and flatpacked in the hallway, and I slept in the new bed last night. Maybe I&#8217;m really tired, maybe I&#8217;m finally home, or maybe <span>[redacted]</span> francs just buys you a damn good bed, but last night marked the first time I&#8217;ve ever slept through my first night in a new place.

  Then I woke up and sat out on the balcony for a few minutes, to look over the city and the mountains before starting my day. I think I&#8217;m going to like it here.

  Pictures are still to follow. I took a few yesterday morning. However, the cable I need to connect the camera to the computer so I can actually get the photos edited and online is packed. Somewhere. Ah, well. It&#8217;s an amazing view. Trust me on this one.

  Yesterday marked the first time I&#8217;ve driven in Zürich, to go get a bunch of must-have stuff at Ikea and to pick up a free sofa bed out in Niederhasli. My impressions: 1. it&#8217;s a pretty reasonable place to drive around, although parking is incredibly scarce in the city, as it should be; 2. Zurich&#8217;s suburbs look very nearly American from behind the wheel of a van; 3. it takes a frighteningly short drive from the center of the city to get you out in the cornfields stuck behind a tractor; and 4. I understand now why most of the people I know who drive here do so via GPS. I&#8217;ve driven through one particular intersection in Milchbuck from every conceivable angle. I&#8217;ve seen more of Oerlikon than I&#8217;d like to have. And it&#8217;s quicker to walk from the Hauptbahnhof to the ETH Hauptgebaude than the way I drove it, although to be fair I often do not take quite so many wrong turns when walking it.

  Next up: assembling Ikea furniture. Again.
