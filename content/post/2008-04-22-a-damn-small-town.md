<span>On my return from Tucson tonight, I walked, as usual, straight from the gate to the taxi stand, because while the 28X (see all previous grumbling about the Port Authority) is perfectly serviceable for a ride from my office (which it stops right in front of) to the airport (which it stops right in front of), it&#8217;s certainly not worth <span>waiting</span> for at midnight for the privilege of spending an hour on the bus and forty minutes walking home.</span>

<div>
  <span>(I shall do my best to ensure this doesn&#8217;t become an &#8220;I Hate The Port Authority&#8221; blog, because that sounds way more boring even than &#8220;An American in Switzerland.&#8221; Maybe once my bike&#8217;s out of the shop.)</span>

  <span>Now, I&#8217;ve had some interesting taxi rides before. I once caught a ride from the airport to my old apartment in the Northside from <span>the taxi driver who lived on my street</span>. This time, I rode in with a former geek from one of Pittsburgh&#8217;s myriad boom-era-gone-bust IT startups. He&#8217;d run in exactly the same circles I had; I&#8217;d been vaguely aware of his company, he&#8217;d been aware of <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/20000713warstories3.asp">one</a> or <a href="http://www.innerwireless.com/vision-over.asp">two</a> of mine. He looked a little familiar, and said I did too. He even claimed to have heard of Leapfrog Research and Development, though given how tiny we were and our absolutely nonexistent marketing budget, I do suspect a bit that he was angling for a tip. On second thought, given how tiny Pittsburgh&#8217;s geek-entrepreneurs-who-didn&#8217;t-move-to-Boston-or-the-Valley community is, maybe not.</span>

  <span>Near as I could figure out, the bust led to a divorce that went nasty (a number was mentioned with respect to his ex-wife&#8217;s lawyer&#8217;s bill that I would take in a minute as an offer on my house) led for unclear but probably easily guessed reasons to midnight runs to the airport in a Yellow Cab. Given &#8220;the two guns [he&#8217;s] had pulled on [him] and the one junkie who nearly plunged a heroin needle into [his] neck,&#8221; though, he&#8217;s about done with the cabbie&#8217;s life, and is hard at work in his copious free time on the next big thing for the next big mobile <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">platform</a>.</span>

  <span>So that&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ll both miss and not miss about Pittsburgh: how unbelievably <span>small</span> it is.</span>
