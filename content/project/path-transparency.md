tl;dr: three parts to this project, all within [MAMI](https://mami-project.eu/)

- development of [pathspider](https://pathspider.net)
- development of the [PTO](https://observatory.mami-project.eu)
- measurement studies using one or both.

Note that the design of the PTO follows the general patterns outlined in On
Repeatable Internet Measurement parts [one](/2014/12/on-repeatable-internet-
measurement-part-one) and [two](/2015/01/on-repeatable-internet-measurement-
part-two).
