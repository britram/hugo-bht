For the current state of this work, read the [CNSM paper](/publication/plus-cnsm-2017/).

Current work on common [wire images](https://britram.github.io/draft-trammell-wire-image/draft-trammell-wire-image.html) is focused on adding a [latency spin bit](https://britram.github.io/draft-trammell-quic-spin/draft-trammell-quic-spin.html) to the IETF-standard QUIC transport protocol, to enable [explicit passive measurability](/publication/ipim-ccr-2017/).
