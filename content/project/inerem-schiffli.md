I spend less time in my kayak than I used to, but writing a guide to sea kayaking in Switzerland remains on my list of things to do in my Copious Free Time. For now, have a look at the first and only installment:

- [Pfäffikersee](/2014/07/dschwiiz-inerem-schiffli-pfaffikersee/)

Coming Soon(tm):

- Sarnersee
- Greifensee
- Obersee and Rhein (taken from trips described [here](/2013/12/from-france-to-austria/))
