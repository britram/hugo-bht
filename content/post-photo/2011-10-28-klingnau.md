This lake, about 45 minutes from ZÃ¼rich by car, is a birder&#8217;s paradise, and a nightmare for photographers&#8217; budgets.

Further out in the lake there were more exotic visitors, but there&#8217;s not much you can do with a twenty pixel image of what&#8217;s probably an egret.

Next stop, [B&H][3], to stare wistfully through the window at too much glass&#8230;
