I&#8217;m old enough to remember Ronald Reagan, but young enough to carry no guilt for having taken part in his election. Now, it turns out, he&#8217;s 100 years old, and apparently it&#8217;s a slow enough news day in Zürich that the [paper of record][1] here decided to point this out. At least they demonstrate [a better memory][2] than most Americans (Headline: &#8220;Republicans&#8217; Selective Inheritance from Reagan: Many myths on the 100th birthday of America&#8217;s 40th president&#8221;).

The problem with Reagan being a hundred is that he&#8217;s dead, and the problem with him being dead is that he can&#8217;t stand up and point out, as apparently even the NZZ knows, that on the ground, he was more an Obama-style pragmatist than an Norquist-style [government-drowning][3] ideologue: &#8220;&#8230;[D]och war er bereit, Kompromisse einzugehen und Ziele als Fernziele zu verstehen, die nicht direkt, sondern nur auf gewundenen Wegen zu erreichen sind.&#8221; But they&#8217;ll continue to wave him around like a flag, people wholly incapable of understanding his true legacy, which isn&#8217;t even very deep. (More on the halcyon days of the early &#8217;90s when the truth could still be spoken about [shady arms deals][4] and the fundamental unworkability of trickle-down economics, in English, in [Salon][5].) Apparently, history is dead. Creative historiography is where the money is.
